Django creates a project folder on my computer, with this content:

project
    manage.py
    project/
        __init__.py
        asgi.py
        settings.py
        urls.py
        wsgi.py

6. Run the Django Project 
Navigate to the /project folder and execute this command in the command prompt

py manage.py runserver

7.Django Create App
py manage.py startapp members

Django creates a folder named members in my project, with this content:
project
    manage.py
    project/
    members/
        migrations/
            __init__.py
        __init__.py
        admin.py
        apps.py
        models.py
        tests.py
        views.py

8. Django Views
There is a views.py in your members folder that looks like this:
project/members/views.py
Find it and open it, and replace the content with this:

from django.shortcuts import render
from django.http import HttpResponse

def members(request):
    return HttpResponse("Hello world!")

9. Django URLs
Create a file named urls.py in the same folder as the views.py file, and type this code in it:

from django.urls import path
from . import views

urlpatterns = [
    path('members/', views.members, name='members'),
]

10. There is a file called urls.py on the my_tennis_club folder, open that file and add the include module in the import statement, 
and also add a path()function in the urlpatterns[] list, with arguments that will route users that comes in via 127.0.0.1:8000/.
project/project/urls.py

from django.contrib import admin
from django.urls import include, path

urlpatterns = [
    path('', include('members.urls')),
    path('admin/', admin.site.urls),
]

py manage.py runserver
